1. ELEGY"The Complaint," by Broome, Engliſh Poets, vol. XL. p. 134, is partly in imitation of this Elegy. N., BY THE WIFE OF ST. ALEXIASOr rather Alexis, a nobleman of Rome; of whom ſee a full account in Blainville's Travels, II. 524. Alexias is probably the name of the poem, as Chriſtias is the hiſtory of Chriſt. N.,

1. SAPPHO TO PHAONThis epiſtle, after having appeared in a variety of collections, was placed at the beginning of Garth's edition of
"Ovid's Epiſtles, by ſeveral hands," 1720;
where it is followed by another tranſlation of it by Mr. Pope; undertaken, as that great poet expreſsly ſays,
"not from any ſuppoſed defect in Sir Carr's tranſlation," but becauſe he had not taken the whole of the original.

1. ODE, IN IMITATION OF PINDAR, ON THE DEATH OF THOMAS EARL OF OSSORYThomas Butler, earl of Oſſory, eldeſt ſon of the duke of Ormond. He was born July 9, 1634; and died July 30, 1680, in the lifetime of his father, leaving behind him the character of one of the beſt and braveſt amongſt the nobility. "His virtue," ſays the writer of his life in the Biographia Britannica,
"was unſpotted in the centre of a luxurious court; his integrity unblemiſhed amidſt all the vices of his times, and his honour untainted through the courſe of his whole life."

He ſucceeded his grandfather in title and eſtate in 1688; and, after holding many conſiderable poſts under king William and queen Anne, was attainted of high treaſon in 1715; and died in exile at Madrid, November 16, 1745.

1. THE REAPERSThis Idyllium is generally excluded by the critics from the number of the paſtorals; but is conſidered as ſuch by Mr. Fawkes, in his tranſlation of the Syracuſan bard. I am aware that in the preface to that elegant performance, not only this of Mr. Bowles, but all former verſions of Theocritus, are reprobated, as ſounding harſhly in the poliſhed •ars of the preſent age. How far the poetry of Bowles deſerves this cenſure, let the reader determine. N.,

1. FROM THE GREEK OF MENAGEM. Menage (who for his great learning was called "The Varro of the 17th century") ſet out in life in the poſt of king's advocate at Angers; but ſoon exchanged the Law for the Church, where he cultivated an acquaintance with the beautiful, the learned, and the great. Beſides • number of other ingenious performances, he p••liſhed at Paris, in 1652, a quarto volume of "Miſcellanea;" a collection of ſeveral pieces, in Greek, Latin, and French, in proſe as well as verſe, compoſed by him on different occaſions; among which was
"La Requeſte des Dictionnaires," one of the moſt ingenious pieces of raillery that ever was written; making all the Dictionaries complain that the Academy's Dictionary will be their ruin, and join in an humble petition to prevent it.
It prevented, however, the ingenious author's obtaining a place in the Academy. He died July 23, 1692, at the age of 79. N..

"The Obſervator."—It was afterwards enlarged to twenty ſtanzas, and publiſhed, in folio, 1693, under the title of "The Wiſh;" a poem which, if it had no other merit, deſerves the higheſt praiſe, for having given riſe to the truly claſſical imitation of it in the Latin poems of a diſtinguiſhed ornament of Weſtminſter School, the late Mr. Vincent Bourne.

1. J. DRYDEN, OF TRINITY COLLEGE, TO HIS FRIEND THE AUTHORPrefixed to
"The Poems of John Hoddeſdon, London, 12mo. 1650."—Neither theſe verſes, nor the prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guiſe," having yet found admittance among the Works of this great Poet; I am happy in being thus able to ſupply the deficiency; and of obſerving, that he was not the author of
"An Elegy on the Uſurper O. C. by the Author of Abſalom and Achitophel, publiſhed to ſhew the Loyalty and Integrity of the Poet. 1681;"
nor of
"The Addreſs of John Dryden, Laureat, to his Highneſs the Prince of Orange, 1689;" nor of the "Familiar Epiſtle to Julian," (erroneouſly aſcribed to him in the ſixth volume of his Miſcellanies publiſhed by Tonſon after the death of the perſon whoſe name they bear, and ſince continued in every edition of his Works.
See vol. II. 1778, p. 157.) which was originally publiſhed about 1683, under the title of
"An Exclamation againſt Julian, Secretary of the Muſes; with the Character of a Libeller [Sir Charles Scrope]. By a Perſon of Quality [Lord Mulgrave]."
Having the original edition before me, I think it neceſſary to point out the following material errors in that of 1778: P. 157. l. 15. r. "leaves"—l. 23. r. "wight"—l. 26. r. "ſhe ſung Euphelia's"—P. 158. l. 20. r. "his ſelf-love,"—l. 21. r. "He dares"—l. 23. r. "the leaſt"—After l. 27, r.
" But, by the monthly flowers diſcharg'd abroad," 'Tis full, brimfull of Paſtoral and Ode." Erewhile he honour'd Birtha," &c.
P. 159. l. 7. r. "his ſquinting looks"—l. 8. r. "The very." P. 160. l. ult. r. "His miſtreſs loſt, yet ſtill his pen," &c.I have been told that there is a poem by Dryden in the "Epithalamia Cantabrigienſia, 1662;" which I never ſaw. N., UPON HIS DIVINE EPIGRAMS.

1. TO THE MARCHIONESS OF NEWCASTLEMargaret, youngeſt daughter of Sir Charles Lucas, married to the marquis (afterwards duke) of Newcaſtle in 1645. Jacob ſays, ſhe had a great deal of wit, and was the moſt voluminous dramatic writer of our female poets; and Langhaine tells us, that all the language and plots of her plays were her own, a commendation which will atone for ſ•me faults in her numerous productions; conſiſting of letters, plays, poems, philoſophical diſcourſes, and orations; all which are enumerated in Ballard's
"Memoirs of learned Ladies."
Amongſt them are, "Poems and Phancies," fol. 1••• and 1664; 19 plays; her own life 1656, and that of the duke her huſband 1667. Mr. Ballard alſo refers to two volumes of her Grace's poems in MS. She was buried in Weſtminſter-Abbey, Jan. 7, 1673-4. N., ON HER INCOMPARABLE POEMS.

1. VOITURE'SThis polite and elegant writer, who was born at Amiens in 1591, and died in 1648, was famous for introducing new and eaſy graces into the French language, and giving a more agreeable turn to many trite and familiar modes of expreſſion, by a happineſs peculiar to himſelf. His irony has been particularly admired for its ſingularity and addreſs; but it has been obſerved, that few authors have ſuffered ſo much by tranſlation, his native beauties being of too delicate a kind to be copied in a foreign language. Voiture, as well as the courtly Waller, was the poet of the ſair; and both, Mr. Granger obſerves, have celebrated the charming counteſs of Carliſle. N. URANIA.
